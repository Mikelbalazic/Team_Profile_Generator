# Team_Profile_Generator

This project utilize the features of object-oriented programming to build a team profile generator application.

When opening the console, the user answers questions regarding the position type of each employee and the various questions that surround that particular employee type (Manager, Engineer, and Intern).

Once the questions are completed by the user, an html is automatically generated and placed in the "dist" folder within the folder directory. The user can then open the html file and see all of the information they had filled out in the console except it is now styled with css and placed in a card format structure with bootstrap. 

This project also utilized the practice of testing code with jest to ensure that the code is functioning properly and following a logical structure.

Overall, this project was informative of how the back-end of an application communicates with both itself and the front-end files of a working directory.
